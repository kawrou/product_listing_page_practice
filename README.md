# react_vite_project_template

A basic project template for React built with Vite. 
Has Vitest installed. 
Followed [this](https://dev.to/janoskocs/setting-up-a-react-project-using-vite-typescript-vitest-2gl2) guide to set up. 

To use this template, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Template to where you keep all your projects:
    ```zsh
    git clone <template-repository-url> <new-project-directory>
    ```
    or clone with only the last commit and none of the history
    ```zsh
    git clone --depth=1 <template-repository-url> <new-project-folder>
    ```
2. Navigate to the cloned repo:
    ```zsh
    cd <new-project-directory>
    ```
3. Update remote URL:
    ```zsh
    git remote set-url origin <new-repository-url>
    ```
4. Install dependencies:
    ```zsh
    npm install
    ```
5. Commit and Push:
    ```zsh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```
